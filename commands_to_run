docker build .

docker build -t prajanshrestha/simpleweb .  (tag the image so that we dont need to use image id)
docker run prajanshrestha/simpleweb  (command to run the image)

docker run -p 8080:8080 prajanshrestha/simpleweb  (this is for port mapping as no traffic from outer world goes to container)
docker run -p 5000:8080 prajanshrestha/simpleweb (input browser port can be 5000/just another example)


docker run -it prajanshrestha/simpleweb sh (run the shell for this image container)
ls   (all node files are copied to root directory.) (use WIRDIR in Dockerfile to copy app file to t /usr/app location)

docker ps 
docker exec -it <container id>
