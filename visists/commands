Installation steps:
1. install docker-compose

The command below will download the 1.28.5 release and save the executable at /usr/local/bin/docker-compose, which will make this software 
globally accessible as docker-compose:

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.28.5/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
Set permissions so that the docker-compose command is executable:

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
Verify that the installation was successful by viewing version information:

docker-compose --version

sudo docker-compose up --build (if you do chnage in the js code then you need to rebuild the app)

sudo docker-compose up -d --build (run docker in background)
sudo docker-compse down (to stop all containers)
